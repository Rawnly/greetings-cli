# Greetings Message
Greeting message in your terminal

```bash
  $ g-msg

  # Good morning, $USER! It's Sunday, December 25 2016
  #
  # LOCAL: < Your local IP >
  # PUBLIC: < Your public IP >
  #
```
# Install
```bash
  $ npm install -g g-msg
```

<!--
## Why?
I did this because some people asked me

> You have an awsome shell! How you did your greetings message?

or

> Can you tell me the source of your shell?

In past id did  a [repo](https://github.com/rawnly/dot-files) for this but is only for **macOS** or **Linux** systems, so now there is also a [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org) package who is **UNIVERSAL** -->
