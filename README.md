<!--
## Why?
I did this because some people asked me

> You have an awsome shell! How you did your greetings message?

or

> Can you tell me the source of your shell?

In past id did  a [repo](https://github.com/rawnly/dot-files) for this but is only for **macOS** or **Linux** systems, so now there is also a [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org) package who is **UNIVERSAL** -->
